This is my blog. I write mostly about software development and related topics,
but you never know what else I might throw in.

> Please bear with me as I migrate my blog posts from my existing [Medium](https://raysuliteanu.medium.com)
> site to this self-hosted, self-managed and free site. Because I am removing
> the paywall, please consider
> [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/raysuliteanu) if you enjoy
> the content! I will probably also set up a GitHub sponsor link.
