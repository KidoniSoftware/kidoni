### About Me

I am a software developer and writer/blogger. I write mostly about software
development and related topics, but you never know what else I might throw in.

I have been a professional software developer for over 30 years. Originally I
was a C programmer working on #Unix #kernel and administration/management
software (Oracle online backup, StorageTek tape silo drivers/CLI)
at Amdahl Corporation. Eventually I transitioned to writing
enterprise #Java software in the fraud prevention space applying neural networks
and other #ML techniques to catch bad guys. Applying AI/ML to fraud prevention and
financial crime has been a theme in my career, using it in areas such as credit
card fraud, application/origination fraud, anti-money laundering (#AML),
know-your-customer (#KYC), and identity verification.

More recently I have been learning #Rust and going back to my roots, to apply Rust
to systems level programming. For example, I've purchased a Raspberry Pi 5 and
want to teach myself how to write a native kernel for it in Rust.
